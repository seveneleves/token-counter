# Token Counter Platform

## Project Description

This platform aims at counting the number of TMC2I - an ERC0 Token deployed on Ethereum TESTNET - received by each possible "candidates". This web application is to be used with the affiliated [voting platform](https://seveneleves.github.io/vote/) in which 1 TMC2I is the equivalent of 1 vote and the [MetaMask browser extension](https://metamask.io/) or [mobile app](https://mobile.metamask.io/) for sending the token.
